# Music-Player-Playlist-Python
This is for my final within my data structures class, but furthermore, this is a program that is both a primitive music player and a music playlist made in the language Python
It houses some bells and whistles that adds flare and nice bonuses that would be nice to have on a music player, however, still ensuring to not take away anything from the program's main concept of being a music playlist and music player front and foremost.
